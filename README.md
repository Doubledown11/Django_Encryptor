An Encryption web application.

Encrypts text using either Python (through Django views) or with JavaScript (Which does so dynamically as users enter letters into the input).

I have implemented the RSA and ElGamal encryption algorithms!



Prime numbers are small static choices for the JavaScript functions as JavaScript can only work with integers up 1.798e+308.


Python can work with arbitrarily high prime numbers and thus I allowed the prime number generator function to generate prime numbers in a pre-determined range. 
As such, the Python functions allow for more randomness in the encryption process and are more effective algorithms. 



I have yet to implement a decryption function, but I may do so at a later date. 


My encryption functions are also prone to collision errors. (When an input leads to an identical encrypted output for different input characters) 
I hope to be able to fix this in future updates.




Thanks!!!!!!!!!
